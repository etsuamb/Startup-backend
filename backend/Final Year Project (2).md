Abstract
StartupConnect Ethiopia addresses the fragmented, informal, and trust-constrained startup
ecosystem in Ethiopia, where innovators face limited access to funding and mentorship while
investors lack a centralized and reliable mechanism for identifying credible startups. Many
youth- and university-led innovations stagnate at the idea or prototype stage due to low visibility,
weak support structures, and the absence of a context-aware digital ecosystem. To address this
challenge, the project adopts a mixed methodology involving a review of relevant literature and
platforms, stakeholder-driven requirement elicitation through surveys and interviews, and
systematic system modeling, followed by iterative development and user acceptance testing. The
resulting solution is a web- and mobile-based platform that supports verified user registration,
startup listing, investor and mentor discovery, structured communication, and reporting, with
integration of local digital payment systems and basic AI-assisted recommendation features.
Evaluation of the system design and prototype demonstrates that StartupConnect Ethiopia
effectively centralizes startup information, formalizes interactions among startups, investors, and
mentors, and reduces information asymmetry within the ecosystem. The platform provides a
scalable and locally relevant digital infrastructure that aligns with national digital transformation
initiatives and has the potential to enhance innovation-driven socio-economic development in
Ethiopia.

Chapter One: Introduction
1.1 Introduction
Ethiopia is experiencing a period of rapid digital transformation, characterized by the emergence
of innovative young entrepreneurs who are developing creative solutions in diverse sectors such
as agriculture, finance, renewable energy, education, and health technology. Despite this
remarkable potential, a significant number of these startups fail to grow or sustain themselves.
The problem is not a lack of innovation or ambition but rather the absence of access, visibility,
and connection to the necessary support systems particularly investors and mentors.[5][7]
Simultaneously, both local and international investors are actively seeking viable startups across
Africa. However, they often encounter challenges in identifying credible and verified ventures in
Ethiopia due to the absence of a centralized database or digital ecosystem. The startup ecosystem
in Ethiopia is thus fragmented, informal, and underdeveloped, limiting the opportunities for
collaboration and growth. Mentors and professionals who are willing to guide and support
emerging entrepreneurs also struggle to find reliable platforms to connect with them.[7]
In response to these gaps, StartupConnect Ethiopia is proposed as a digital platform designed
to serve as a unifying ecosystem for startups, investors, and mentors. The platform goes beyond
simple networking it provides an organized, transparent, and trustworthy environment for
engagement, investment, and mentorship. Through this system:
● Startups can gain visibility, access funding, and obtain expert mentorship. [7].
● Investors can explore verified and data-backed startups for credible investment
opportunities.[5][4]
● Mentors can contribute to the development of new innovators and strengthen Ethiopia’s
digital economy.[5]
Ultimately, the platform aims to empower Ethiopian innovators, bridge the gap between
creativity and opportunity, and promote sustainable economic growth through entrepreneurship
and technology.
1.2 Statement of the Problem
1.2.1 Existing System
Currently, the startup ecosystem in Ethiopia functions largely through informal and fragmented
networks. Startups rely heavily on personal contacts, occasional pitch events, or social media
14
exposure to connect with investors and mentors. This approach is inefficient and excludes many
talented innovators who lack the necessary connections or resources.[5][7].
While global platforms such as AngelList, Gust, and SeedInvest have successfully linked
startups and investors in developed markets, these platforms are not well-suited for the Ethiopian
context. They often require complex regulatory compliance, are designed for mature markets,
and lack integration with local financial systems and languages. Consequently, Ethiopian startups
are left underserved and disconnected from global opportunities. [5][4]
1.2.2 Major Problems of the Existing System
Ethiopia is currently witnessing a strong wave of youth-driven innovation, particularly in the
technology and digital entrepreneurship sectors. Each year, hundreds of startups and
university-based projects emerge with creative solutions in education, agriculture, health, and
fintech. However, despite this growing enthusiasm and potential, many of these startups fail to
progress beyond the idea or prototype stage. The primary issue is not a shortage of innovation,
but rather the absence of structured support systems that provide funding, mentorship, visibility,
and legal clarity. [5][6]
The existing Ethiopian startup ecosystem functions mainly through informal networks. Access to
investors, mentors, or resources often depends on personal connections, referrals, or word of
mouth. This leaves many capable innovators unseen, especially those without social or
institutional links to established networks. Consequently, information asymmetry arises startups
struggle to find investors who understand their vision, while investors lack reliable means to
verify credible, investable startups. [5][4].
To understand these challenges more deeply, interviews were conducted with Minab
```
Technologies (a veteran software company with 11 years in operation), Kuraz Technologies (a
```
```
six-year-old early-stage digital startup), and IE Networks (a leading technology infrastructure
```
```
company with extensive experience in digital transformation projects). Their insights revealed a
```
consistent set of challenges that span across experience levels from newly formed startups to
established firms. [5][6].
Barriers to Growth in Ethiopia’s Startup Ecosystem
The Ethiopian startup ecosystem faces significant structural and cultural challenges that hinder
innovation and growth. Established companies like Minab Technologies highlight a pervasive
self-funding culture, limited mentorship, short-term profit focus, and weak policy and legal
support, making investment risky. Early-stage startups, exemplified by Kuraz Technologies,
struggle with restricted access to investors due to reliance on personal networks, low visibility,
trust gaps, inadequate mentorship structures, and legal uncertainties. Similarly, experienced firms
like IE Networks report bureaucratic, inconsistent legal and policy frameworks, investor
hesitation, and fragmented ecosystem integration. Collectively, these issues create an
environment where startups lack visibility, mentorship, funding, and regulatory clarity, and
15
investors face difficulty in identifying credible opportunities, emphasizing the need for a
centralized, verifiable, and supportive digital platform to bridge these gaps.
1.2.3 Proposed System
StartupConnect Ethiopia is a centralized digital platform designed to bridge the gaps within
Ethiopia’s entrepreneurial ecosystem by connecting startups, investors, and mentors in a secure
and verified environment. The system aims to enhance visibility, streamline investment
processes, and provide structured mentorship to support the growth of innovative ventures.
The platform accommodates four main types of users:
● Admin: Oversees the entire system, manages user verification, monitors activities,
generates reports, maintains platform settings, and ensures integrity and compliance
within the ecosystem.
● Investor: Enables investors to discover and evaluate startups, receive AI-assisted
recommendations, communicate directly with founders, manage funding processes, and
track portfolio performance.
● Startup: Allows entrepreneurs to create verified profiles, showcase projects, apply for
investment, request mentorship, manage documents, provide progress updates, and
communicate with investors and mentors.
● Mentor: Provides structured guidance to startups by accepting mentorship requests,
sharing resources, scheduling and hosting mentorship sessions, tracking progress, and
communicating with startups.
By integrating these functionalities, StartupConnect Ethiopia fosters collaboration, builds trust,
and ensures that startups can efficiently progress from ideas to scalable businesses. Features such
as local payment integration, mentorship tracking, and AI-assisted recommendations enhance
usability, transparency, and decision-making for all stakeholders, establishing a comprehensive
digital ecosystem tailored to the Ethiopian context.
1.2.4 Advantages of the Proposed System
The proposed platform provides a verified and trustworthy environment for startup–investor
interactions within Ethiopia, reducing information asymmetry and enhancing confidence. It
increases the visibility of startups to investors, improving access to funding opportunities. By
connecting entrepreneurs with experienced mentors, the system supports structured guidance and
professional development. Verification mechanisms reduce the risk of misinformation or
fraudulent ventures, while regional inclusivity enables startups from outside major cities to
16
participate. Accessible via both web and mobile applications, the platform advances Ethiopia’s
national objectives for digital transformation and innovation-driven growth, fostering a more
connected, credible, and sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystem..
1.3 Motivation
The primary motivation for developing StartupConnect Ethiopia stems from the recognition
that many innovative student and youth-led projects in Ethiopia end prematurely after
competitions or academic presentations. These projects possess the potential for
commercialization and societal impact but often lack the exposure and mentorship necessary to
progress beyond the prototype stage.
As software engineering students, the project team identified an opportunity to create a
sustainable bridge between innovation and investment. The motivation is driven by the desire to
empower young innovators, promote digital inclusivity, and strengthen the culture of
entrepreneurship in Ethiopia.
StartupConnect Ethiopia represents a step toward building a nationally integrated startup
ecosystem, one that recognizes talent, provides visibility, and connects innovators with the
financial and professional resources they need to grow.
1.4 Scope and Limitation of the Project
1.4.1 Scope of the Project
The scope of this project includes the design and development of a web-based and
mobile-based platform that connects startups, investors, and mentors in Ethiopia. The platform
aims to improve visibility, access to investment, and structured mentorship within the national
innovation ecosystem. Specifically, the system will include:
● User registration and authentication mechanisms for all user types.
● Startup and investor profile management, enabling the upload of business ideas, pitch
decks, financial summaries, and project details.
● Mentorship matching and communication tools to support structured guidance and
progress tracking.
● Integration of local digital payment systems such as Telebirr and CBE Birr for subscription
and service-related payments.
● Administrative dashboard for managing user accounts, verifying startups, and monitoring
system activity.
● Multilingual interface, currently supporting English and Amharic only to ensure inclusivity
17
and accessibility.
● Development of both web and mobile applications to maximize usability and reach across
different devices and regions.
● Initial focus on AASTU-based startups, with planned expansion to other universities and
innovation centers nationwide.
```
Additional Scope Point (new):
```
● Basic AI-assisted modules, including document summarization and startup–investor
recommendation features, designed as extensible components for future enhancement.
This scope provides a realistic yet scalable foundation, ensuring that the platform can grow as
user adoption increases.
1.4.2 Limitation of the Project
While the system aims to deliver comprehensive functionality, several constraints shape the
project’s initial phase. The main limitations include:
● No direct financial transaction processing.
```
The platform only integrates with payment gateways; actual fund transfers are handled by
```
existing financial institutions.
● No in-house legal or financial consulting services.
The system facilitates connections to verified professionals but does not provide these services
internally.
● Language support is limited to English and Amharic.
Additional Ethiopian languages may be added in future development phases based on user
demand and resources.
● The system will initially operate only within Ethiopia, with the potential for regional
```
expansion (e.g., to East African innovation hubs) in later stages.
```
● Advanced AI features are limited in the initial version.
Predictive analytics, automated verification, and investment scoring systems will be introduced
gradually as the platform evolves.
1.4.3 Registration Requirements and User Information
To make the registration process clear and operational, the platform should specify the
information required from each user type during sign-up. In this project, registration is divided
into two parts: account creation and profile completion/verification.

For all users, the system should collect the basic account information shown below:
● Full name
● Email address
● Phone number
● Password and confirm password
● Preferred language
● Acceptance of terms and privacy policy

For startup users, the registration form should also collect the following profile information:
● Startup name
● Sector or industry
● Startup stage
● Region and city
● Funding goal
● Startup type, year founded, team size, founder role, website, social links, and short description

For investor users, the registration form should collect:
● Company or investor name
● Investment range
● Areas of interest or preferred sectors

For mentor users, the registration form should collect:
● Area of expertise
● Years of experience

In addition to the form data, some supporting documents may be requested during onboarding or
admin verification, especially for startups. These may include identity proof, business
registration proof, pitch decks, business plans, and financial summaries. This means users do
not necessarily need to upload every document at the first sign-up step, but they should provide
the required core information before the account can be reviewed and approved.

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Introduction
The global landscape of early-stage venture capital has been fundamentally reshaped by digital
platforms that democratize access to funding. Platforms such as AngelList, Gust, and
SeedInvest serve as digital marketplaces that match startups with investors and mentors while
ensuring legal compliance, standardized documentation, and transparent due diligence. These
systems provide useful models for emerging markets.[14][16].
This chapter reviews existing literature on digital startup ecosystems, investment
matchmaking platforms, and regulatory frameworks, with a particular emphasis on how
global best practices can be localized to Ethiopia. It addresses the nature of digital startup
ecosystems, matchmaking platforms, the role of AI, and the specific challenges and opportunities
within the Ethiopian context.[19]
2.2 Digital Startup Ecosystems and Key Actors
Digital startup ecosystems consist of multiple interrelated actors, entrepreneurs, investors,
mentors, universities, government, and service providers that collide in a shared environment to
enable innovation. In emerging markets, ecosystems often struggle with funding gaps, regulatory
ambiguity, and fragmented institutional support. Studies highlight that a well-functioning
ecosystem requires not only technological infrastructure but also strong networks, policy
support, and trust-building mechanisms. [19].
2.3 Empirical Studies on the Ethiopian Ecosystem
```
2.3.1 JICA & MInT Startup Ecosystem Report (2023)
```
```
The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), in collaboration with Ethiopia’s Ministry of
```
```
Innovation and Technology (MInT), conducted a comprehensive survey of the Ethiopian startup
```
ecosystem, sampling 300 startups and 80 stakeholders. Their findings reveal a nascent but
promising ecosystem: regulatory and policy barriers remain significant, with unclear frameworks
for startup registration and limited startup-specific legal infrastructure. Funding constraints are
evident, as investors report small ticket sizes compared to more mature ecosystems, underscoring
the need to de-risk investment. Additionally, many startups have not undergone formal valuation
59% of surveyed firms, for instance, lacked a structured valuation process. Gender dynamics also
surfaced, with access disparities for women-led ventures. While the report offers deep insight, it
is limited by its geographic concentration in Addis Ababa and by its reliance on self-reported
data, which may omit informal or very early-stage firms.
```
Relevance: For StartupConnect Ethiopia, this report provides empirical justification for a
```
verified matchmaking platform. The lack of valuation among many startups and the risk
perceived by investors strongly support the development of a system that can validate and
showcase startup potential credibly. Moreover, the regulatory challenges highlighted suggest that
24
our platform should be designed in alignment with government efforts and ecosystem
builders.[19]
2.3.2 Cenfri’s Guidance on Startup Support in Ethiopia
Cenfri, a research group, has published a policy guide that outlines how to structure a fund to
support digital startups in Ethiopia. One major recommendation is against designing funds that
target specific sectors: such targeted funds might unintentionally distort markets, pushing
entrepreneurs toward industries just because they are funded. Rather, Cenfri suggests a more
market-driven, broad-based funding approach aligned with national digital strategies like
Digital Ethiopia 2025. While the guide is more policy than technical in nature, its
recommendations are essential for building a sustainable and inclusive financing ecosystem.
```
Relevance: This aligns with StartupConnect Ethiopia’s need to remain sector-agnostic and
```
inclusive. The guide also supports the notion of collaborating with government entities to align
platform goals with national policy, improving legitimacy and potential sustainability.
```
2.3.3 BIC Africa’s ESO Ecosystem Mapping (2022/23)
```
The European Union funded BIC Africa conducted a mapping of Entrepreneur Support
```
Organizations in Ethiopia, identifying 125 ESOs (incubators, accelerators, mentorship programs,
```
```
etc.). The mapping highlights that while support structures are increasing, they remain
```
fragmented and poorly networked. Many ESOs do not have strong linkages with each other, and
coordination is limited.
```
Relevance: This fragmentation directly supports our project’s premise: there is a need for a
```
```
centralized digital space to bring together these diverse actors (startups, mentors, support
```
```
organizations). By onboarding ESOs, the platform can serve as a bridge that increases
```
connectivity and maximizes the impact of these organizations.
2.3.4 Dealroom / RISA / GrowthAfrica Report State of Startup Innovation in
Ethiopia
An insight report, backed by GrowthAfrica, Systemic Innovation, and the RISA Fund, analyzed
```
562 companies (489 startups) listed in Dealroom. It found that the total enterprise value (TEV)
```
of the Ethiopian startup ecosystem is approximately US$302 million. However, investment
remains concentrated in a few high-performing companies, and many startups are likely
excluded from the dataset due to limitations in public data.
```
Relevance: This report validates the economic potential of Ethiopian startups, supporting our
```
platform’s mission to highlight investable ventures. However, its data limitations also stress the
importance of building a local, verified database to ensure startups that are “off-Dealroom” also
gain visibility.
25
```
2.3.5 EdTech Financing Challenges (Shega)
```
```
A recent assessment by Shega (in collaboration with Reach for Change) focused on the EdTech
```
ecosystem in Ethiopia. They found a major funding gap, with 52% of surveyed EdTech startups
```
having less than 500,000 birr (very small seed funding) and only a few breaking out into higher
```
funding bands. Moreover, while EdTech represents a significant portion of the startup ecosystem
```
(21% in the JICA report), most ventures remain in early phases.
```
```
Relevance: This highlights that sector-specific challenges are real in Ethiopia. For
```
```
StartupConnect Ethiopia, this means you might want to include sector segmentation (e.g.,
```
```
EdTech, AgriTech) and perhaps tailored matching for investors interested in specific domains.
```
Also, the need for mentorship is acute in EdTech mentors who understand education and
technology can be more effective.
2.4 International and Technological Models for Platform Design
To build a globally informed but locally relevant platform, it helps to review international
models and academic research on matching platforms and AI-driven systems.
2.4.1 Global Platform Examples
1. AngelList
AngelList is a globally recognized platform that connects startups, angel investors, and job
seekers. It supports features like investment syndicates, talent recruitment, and deal flow. Its
success demonstrates how an online platform can scale matchmaking, but its model is based on
developed-market regulatory frameworks and investor sophistication.[13].
Relevance for Startup Connect Ethiopia: This model is critical for capital aggregation.
```
Implementing a similar structure (a local form of SPV) would allow Startup Connect Ethiopia
```
to manage the complexity of numerous small investments under a single entity on the startup's
cap table, simplifying the legal overhead for early-stage companies[14].
Regulatory and Non-U.S. Investor Implications: AngelList deals strictly adhere to U.S.
```
accreditation requirements. For non-U.S. investors (like the Ethiopian diaspora), the platform
```
structure facilitates investment across borders. While the tax structure is complex, the
mechanism for pooling international capital under a single, simplified investment entity is a
valuable blueprint for managing diaspora engagement[16].
Limitations for Ethiopia:
· Regulatory misalignment: AngelList’s financial model and regulatory assumptions may
not hold in Ethiopia.
26
· Trust gap: Without strong local verification, just creating a listing platform may not
solve the credibility issues Ethiopian startups face.
2. SeedInvest: Model for Compliance and Rigorous Curation
SeedInvest is an equity crowdfunding platform that “screens and vets” startups before they can
raise funds. It allows smaller investors to participate, democratizing early-stage investing.
Relevance for Startup Connect Ethiopia: Given the structural risks inherent in emerging
markets, SeedInvest's stringent curation model offers a powerful lesson. The platform must
prioritize quality over quantity in its deal flow to build investor trust and mitigate risk.
```
Furthermore, SeedInvest’s utilization of multiple U.S. securities exemptions (Reg CF, Reg A+,
```
```
Reg D) highlights the absolute necessity of anchoring the platform's transactions to clear, explicit
```
securities regulations, which in the Ethiopian context must align with the Ethiopian Capital
```
Market Authority (ECMA).
```
Limitations for Ethiopia:
· Crowdfunding regulations: Equity crowdfunding may be restricted or underdeveloped
in Ethiopian law.
· Investor sophistication: Local investors may lack experience with equity crowdfunding,
making adoption slow or risky.
3. Gust Platform: Model for Deal Flow and Operational Standards
Gust operates primarily as an ecosystem and deal flow management system for organized
investor groups, rather than directly structuring SPVs.
Relevance for Startup Connect Ethiopia: Gust's strength lies in standardizing the due
diligence and vetting process. For a platform like Startup Connect Ethiopia operating in a
nascent market, adopting standardized templates for pitches, financial reporting, and investor
```
updates is essential. This focus on "Company as a Service (CaaS)" functionality, ensuring local
```
startups are investor-ready and compliant, is paramount for building confidence among investors,
particularly those accustomed to international standards.
2.4.2 AI, Matching, and Mentorship Research
Fused Large Language Model for Predicting Startup Success
```
Maarouf, Feuerriegel, & Pröllochs (2024) propose a model that uses founder self-descriptions
```
```
(text) plus traditional metrics to predict startup success. They show that these text descriptions
```
significantly improve predictive power beyond structured data.
```
· Strengths: Helps investors discern potential from narrative, not just numbers; useful
```
when traditional financial data is unavailable.
27
```
· Limitations: Dependence on high-quality textual descriptions; potential lack of
```
```
interpretability; bias in training data if applied to local contexts without adaptation.
```
· Relevance: For StartupConnect Ethiopia, this model suggests how AI can recommend
high-potential startups to investors even when financial data is sparse but you would
need localized data for training to ensure relevance.
Deep Learning for Success Prediction and Simulated VC Portfolios
```
Potanin, Chertok, Zorin & Shtabtsovsky (2023) develop a deep learning model using Crunchbase
```
data to simulate VC decision-making. They demonstrate that their model can accurately identify
strong startups at early stages and generate good return when backtested.
```
· Strengths: Provides a data-driven way to simulate and support investment decisions;
```
helps investors triage startup deal flow.
```
· Limitations: Requires high-quality data; model trained on data from developed
```
```
markets; may not account for local risk factors, regulation, or currency issues.
```
· Relevance: Your platform could implement a similar predictive tool but must collect
local data and possibly retrain or adapt the model to Ethiopian startup dynamics.
Digital Mentor: Conversational Bot for Hypothesis Generation
```
Melegati & Wang (2022) propose a “Digital Mentor,” a conversational bot that helps startup
```
```
founders map out their business hypotheses and assumptions (via a “HyMap”) without a human
```
facilitator.
· Strengths: Scalable, reduces barrier to early mentorship, helps founders crystallize their
ideas.
```
· Limitations: Prototype-level; may not understand context deeply; lacks personalization
```
for different types of founders or sectors.
· Relevance: In StartupConnect Ethiopia, this bot can serve as a first layer of
mentorship, helping mentees frame their thinking before engaging human mentors.
This is especially useful given mentorship resource constraints.
```
InSearch: Interactive Investor Recommendation System
```
```
Zhang, Wang, Li & Zhang (2022) present InSearch, a visual-analytics system to help founders
```
discover and interactively explore potential crowdfunding investors. Their system uses Graph
Neural Networks to model investor behavior and preferences, and provides explanations for
recommendations.
```
· Strengths: Interactive and transparent; supports trust by explaining why investors are
```
```
recommended; allows founders to explore investor histories.
```
28
```
· Limitations: Requires detailed data on investors; may be complicated for users not
```
familiar with data-driven tools.
· Relevance: A tool modeled after InSearch could be implemented in StartupConnect
Ethiopia to help founders navigate investor profiles more meaningfully and to build
trust by explaining matches.
2.5 Digital Finance Integration and the Evolving Ethiopian Context
The successful implementation of digital investment platforms requires a foundational digital
```
financial services (DFS) ecosystem. While Ethiopia has faced structural barriers, recent policy
```
reforms have created a tangible pathway for FinTech innovation.
2.5.1. Infrastructure and Access Constraints
A primary impediment remains the low penetration of digital financial services. Challenges
```
include:
```
· Physical Infrastructure: Limited and unreliable access to electricity and low
ownership of feature/mobile handsets, especially in rural areas.
· Digital Literacy: A high proportion of the population relies on the informal financial
system, necessitating solutions that are extremely user-friendly and offer
low-bandwidth or agent-assisted access modes.
· Cash Dominance: The economy remains heavily cash-dependent, although recent
mandates requiring government offices to accept digital payments are accelerating the
cashless transition.
Strategic Response for Startup Connect Ethiopia: The platform must be designed with a
mobile-first, low-data consumption philosophy, potentially leveraging existing mobile money
agent networks to facilitate cash-in/cash-out for local investments, thus bridging the physical
infrastructure gap.
2.5.2. Regulatory Transformation and the Pathway to Compliance
Ethiopia's regulatory environment, previously restrictive, has undergone rapid modernization,
offering key enablers for Startup Connect Ethiopia:[18]
```
· The Ethiopian Capital Market Authority (ECMA): Established to regulate the
```
capital market, ECMA is the definitive body for securities issuance. The existence of
the ECMA Regulatory Sandbox is a critical opportunity, allowing innovative capital
```
market products and services (like a digital investment platform) to be tested in a
```
controlled environment with regulatory support and tailored guidance.
29
```
· Enabling FinTech Directives (NBE): The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) has
```
revised its directives, specifically allowing mobile money service providers to
facilitate capital market products. This is a direct technological and regulatory link
that Startup Connect Ethiopia can leverage to process transactions using existing
wallet infrastructure.
```
· Startup Proclamation Act (2025): This landmark legislation explicitly exempts
```
foreign startups and foreign startup ecosystem builders from previous minimum
```
foreign capital requirements (USD 200,000). This single policy change
```
fundamentally removes a major barrier to attracting diaspora and international
venture capital, significantly improving the viability of the project.
2.6 Gaps in Literature and Implications for StartupConnect Ethiopia
Based on the reviewed literature, the following gaps are particularly relevant to the design and
justification of our platform:
1. Absence of Comprehensive, Verified Startup Data
o Many Ethiopian startups are not listed in global databases like Dealroom, and
```
local data is fragmented (JICA report, RISA data).
```
o Implication: The platform must act as a central repository for verified startup
data, encouraging startups to upload documentation, business plans, and
regular updates.
2. Trust Deficit Between Stakeholders
o Investors in Ethiopia express concern about risk, verification, and valuation
```
(JICA report).
```
```
o Implication: Incorporate multi-level verification (document checks, third
```
```
parties, ESOs) and transparent matching logic.
```
3. Limited Use of Advanced Matching Technologies Locally
o While AI models exist, few platforms in Ethiopia currently leverage them.
```
o Implication: Leverage AI (LLM + structured data) for matching, but retrain /
```
```
adapt on local data; include explanation for matches to build trust.
```
4. Mentorship Resource Constraints
```
o There is a shortage of structured, scalable mentorship in Ethiopia; many ESOs
```
are fragmented.
30
```
o Implication: Use a hybrid mentorship model (bot + human), and encourage
```
ESO integration, matching mentors with startups based on expertise,
availability, and domain.
5. Sustainability and Policy Alignment
```
o Policy guides (e.g., Cenfri) caution against narrow funding; the ecosystem is
```
rapidly evolving.
o Implication: The platform should design a sustainable business model
```
(subscription, service fees, partnerships) and align with government strategies
```
```
(MInT, Digital Ethiopia).
```
2.7 Strategic Synthesis and Operationalizing Startup Connect Ethiopia
The analysis confirms that the global principles of compliance, curation, and aggregation are
necessary, but must be adapted to the Ethiopian market using the new regulatory tools. The
proposed strategic framework for Startup Connect Ethiopia is defined by four operational
```
pillars:
```
1. Capital Aggregation: Drawing a benchmark from the AngelList SPV model, the
platform must address the need for simplified investment vehicles in Ethiopia. The
```
operational strategy is to develop a mechanism (similar to an SPV) for local capital
```
pooling that is approved by the ECMA under their new directives, allowing the
platform to present a single, clean investor entity to the startup, drastically
simplifying the cap table.
2. Rigorous Curation: Benchmarking against SeedInvest's stringent vetting, the
platform recognizes the low investor confidence and inherent emerging market
risk. The strategy involves implementing Gust-style deal-flow management with a
highly selective acceptance rate. This focuses on investor protection, transparency,
and building market trust by ensuring only the most vetted opportunities reach the
investors.
3. Compliance & Testing: The regulatory benchmarks (U.S. Reg CF/Reg A+) translate
into leveraging the ECMA Regulatory Sandbox and new NBE Directives. The
essential strategy is to apply to the ECMA Regulatory Sandbox to test the
platform’s business model, legal structure, and compliance framework before full
market launch, which is crucial for guaranteeing regulatory alignment and
minimizing risk.
4. Access & Reach: Global digital investment platforms offer universal access, but
Startup Connect Ethiopia must address low digital literacy and cash dominance
in Ethiopia. The operational strategy is to design a mobile-first, low-bandwidth UI
```
and strategically integrate with licensed mobile money providers (enabled by NBE
```
31
```
directives) for seamless on-ramping of local funds, effectively bridging the digital and
```
cash divide.
The research gap is now closed by identifying the specific regulatory tools available. The focus
shifts from if a platform can be built, to how Startup Connect Ethiopia will utilize the ECMA
Sandbox and the Startup Proclamation to launch a fully compliant, locally adapted, and scalable
digital investment platform.
2.8 Conceptual Framework
Based on the above, the conceptual framework for StartupConnect Ethiopia includes:
· Inputs: Verified startup data, investor preferences, mentor expertise
· Processes: Verification, AI-driven matching, interactive exploration, mentorship
sessions
· Infrastructure: Admin dashboard, payment gateway, multilingual UI, analytics
· Outputs: Matched relationships, mentorship engagements, funding interest
· Outcomes: Increased trust, visibility, resource flow, and ecosystem cohesion
```
· Moderators: Regulatory environment, inclusion (gender, region), sector diversity
```
2.9 Summary
The literature strongly supports the need for StartupConnect Ethiopia: the Ethiopian startup
ecosystem faces fragmentation, trust issues, and data gaps. International and academic models
```
(AngelList, SeedInvest, AI-based prediction, interactive matching) offer proven strategies, but
```
must be carefully adapted to the local context. A platform that centralizes verified data, uses AI
for intelligent matching, provides scalable mentorship, and aligns with local policy could
significantly strengthen Ethiopia’s startup ecosystem.
32
CHAPTER THREE: SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND MODELING
3.1 Overview
After gathering detailed information about the limitations of existing platforms and
understanding the needs of our users, we conducted a structured system analysis to clearly define
the objectives of our platform. This chapter presents the modeling activities used during the
analysis phase.
First, scenario based modeling is used to identify the main actors of the system and describe
how they interact with the platform through well-defined use cases. These scenarios are
supported with UML Use Case Diagrams and UML Activity Diagrams to illustrate user goals
and workflow behavior.
Next, behavioral modeling captures the dynamic operation of the system using UML Sequence
Diagrams, which show the flow of events and communication between components during key
interactions.
Finally, class-based modeling identifies the core classes of the system and represents their
attributes and relationships using a UML Class Diagram.
Together, these modeling techniques provide a clear and complete understanding of how the
system behaves, interacts and is structured, ensuring a solid foundation for implementation.
3.2 Scenario-Based Modeling
Scenario-based modeling was applied to understand how end users and external actors intend to
interact with the platform. This method helps translate real-world needs into clear, traceable
system requirements. Each scenario is expressed using UML Use Cases and Activity Diagrams,
which together describe both what the system should do and how users will flow through
essential tasks.[24]
3.2.1 Use Case Identification
In the proposed StartupConnect Ethiopia platform, use case identification is a crucial step for
defining the system’s functional requirements. These use cases describe the interactions between
```
external actors (startups, investors, mentors, and administrators) and the system, outlining what
```
each actor can accomplish. Through the analysis of user needs, workflow diagrams, and platform
expectations, the following use cases have been identified. These use cases capture all system
functionalities required to support startup–investor–mentor collaboration, business project
management, investment processing, communication features, and administrative
operations.[23][24]

3.2.2 Actor Identification
The StartupConnect Ethiopia platform involves multiple categories of users who interact with
the system to accomplish specific objectives. Each actor plays a distinct role in the digital
ecosystem, and understanding their responsibilities is essential for defining system behavior. The
following actors have been identified based on system analysis and functional requirements.
A Startup represents individual entrepreneurs or founding teams seeking investment,
mentorship, or professional guidance for their innovative projects. They are the primary content
creators on the platform, responsible for adding project information, uploading business
documents, and initiating interaction with investors and mentors.
Startups utilize the system to publish their project profiles, including problem statements,
business models, financial projections, and pitch decks. They can search for appropriate
investors who align with their industry, funding stage, and investment requirements. In addition,
startups may request mentorship from experienced professionals to refine their ideas, improve
their strategy, and gain industry insights.
They also maintain communication with investors and mentors through chat and video sessions,
monitor their application status, manage offers received, and update their project’s progress over
time. Their role is essential, as they provide the core content and drive the activity flow within
the platform.
An Investor represents either an individual angel investor, investment firm, venture capitalist, or
organization that provides financial resources for promising startups. Investors use the system to
explore new opportunities, review startup profiles, and evaluate applications submitted to them.
They can filter startups based on predefined criteria such as sector, maturity stage, traction, and
investment needs. Investors also receive AI-based recommendations that match their investment
preferences with relevant startup projects. After reviewing proposals, they may accept or decline
investment requests, send funding offers, and track the progress of invested projects.
40
Investors interact using messaging tools to communicate with startup founders, participate in
video consultations, and finalize financial transactions within the platform. Their activities
ensure the funding cycle flows efficiently and transparently.
A Mentor represents an experienced professional, industry expert, business consultant, or
entrepreneurship trainer who provides advisory services to startups. Mentors play a crucial role
in supporting early-stage companies by offering feedback, conducting training sessions,
reviewing business plans, and facilitating strategic planning.
Mentors can browse startups seeking support, accept or decline mentorship requests, and
schedule mentorship sessions using the platform’s communication tools. They may offer

3.5 Behavioral/Dynamic Modeling
We have conducted behavioral modeling to indicate how the system will respond to external
events or stimuli. To achieve this, we have represented the behavior of the systemas a function of
specific events and time.
3.5.1 sequence diagram
The sequence diagram illustrates the complete end-to-end operational flow of the StartupConnect
Ethiopia platform, detailing how all four primary user roles Startup, Investor, Mentor, and Admin
interact with the system and with each other. It also visualizes how AI-driven features and
payment services support these interactions. The diagram is structured around the platform’s
major functional areas: registration and verification, AI-powered matching, investment
workflows, mentorship workflows, communication, payment handling, admin oversight, and
exception paths.[21][22]
1. Registration & Verification Workflow
```
All users (Startup, Investor, Mentor) begin by creating an account and submitting required
```
profile details.
The Admin receives verification requests and performs manual approval.
● If approved → The user becomes Active and gains access to their dashboard.
● If rejected → The workflow ends with a Rejected notification.
This ensures that only authentic, verified users can participate in investments and mentorship
processes.
2. AI-Driven Recommendations
Whenever a Startup, Investor, or Mentor initiates a search:
● The platform sends profile and project data to the AI Module.
● The AI analyzes interests, skills, funding size, and compatibility signals.
```
● The system returns ranked recommendations (e.g., suitable investors for startups,
```
```
relevant startups for investors, suitable mentors for startups).
```
This enables smarter, personalized matchmaking for all parties.
3. Investment Workflow
82
A Startup applies to an Investor after viewing recommendations or search results.
The Investor reviews the application and either:
● Accepts → Sends an investment offer
● Rejects → The workflow moves to the "Rejected" alternate path
If the Startup accepts the offer:
● The payment process is initiated through the Payment Gateway.
● The Investor completes the transaction.
● The Startup receives confirmation once payment succeeds.
After funding, the Startup can:
● Track payments
● Update progress
● Upload milestone reports
If payment fails, the diagram includes a Failed Payment alternate path.
4. Mentorship Workflow
A Startup selects a mentor via search or AI recommendations and submits a mentorship request.
The Mentor can:
● Accept → Scheduling and mentorship sessions begin
```
● Reject → The startup is notified (alternate rejection path)
```
Once accepted:
● Mentor schedules sessions
● Video calls and resource sharing take place
● Mentor submits guidance reports
● Startup marks mentorship completion
Both parties exchange feedback at the end of the mentorship cycle.
5. Communication & Collaboration
The platform supports direct communication channels:
● Direct messaging between Startup ↔ Investor or Startup ↔ Mentor
● Video conferencing for meetings and interviews
● Document exchange for reports, proposals, and session summaries
83
This interaction layer ensures seamless relationship-building within the platform.
6. Payment & Transaction Oversight
All financial activities, startup funding and mentor compensation, flow through the Payment
Gateway.
● Investors initiate payments for startup investment.
● The system triggers mentor payments upon mentorship acceptance.
● The Admin oversees all payment events for compliance and dispute resolution.
Failed payments trigger specific exception flows included in the diagram.
7. Admin Monitoring & Platform Management
Admins have global oversight across the platform:
● User account moderation
● Content monitoring
● Fraud detection and removal of suspicious accounts
● Analytics and reporting
● Oversight of all transactions
The admin role ensures platform integrity and proper functioning of all workflows.
8. Alternate / Exception Paths Included
The diagram also covers non-ideal but realistic paths:
● Startup rejected during onboarding
● Investor rejected
● Mentor rejected
● Payment failure during investment or mentorship
● Mentorship request rejection
● Investment application rejection

Chapter Four - System Design
4.1 Overview
This chapter describes how the system’s components, modules, data and interfaces are organized
to support collaboration between startups, investors, mentors and administrators. The goal of the
design is to translate system requirements into a clear and practical structure that can be
implemented efficiently.
The system design focuses on ensuring that the platform can support real world usage scenarios
such as project creation, investment management, mentorship coordination, communication and
administrative control. By defining the architecture and system elements early, the design helps
reduce development complexity, avoid unnecessary implementation costs and improve system
performance and user experience.
4.2 System Design
The system design follows a modular and object-oriented approach to ensure clarity, scalability
and ease of maintenance. The design decomposes the system into well-defined components each
106
responsible for a specific function such as user management, project handling, investment
processing, mentorship coordination, communication and administration.
The system is designed using a layered structure, separating presentation, application logic and
data management. This separation allows independent development and modification of system
components without affecting the entire platform. Core business entities such as users, projects,
investments, mentorships and transactions are modeled as classes to reflect real world
interactions within the startup ecosystem.
4.2.1 Design Goal
The system is designed to deliver a reliable, usable, secure and scalable platform that supports
effective collaboration among startups, investors and mentors. The following design goals
guided the system design:
- Reliability : The system is expected to operate consistently in an internet based
environment and provide uninterrupted access to essential services such as
authentication, project management and communication features.
- Usability : The system is emphasized to ensure that users can interact with the platform
easily regardless of their technical background. The interface and system flow are
designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing new users to complete basic tasks quickly
while enabling experienced users to work efficiently.
- Reusability: Is achieved through the use of modular and object-oriented design
principles. Common functionalities are encapsulated in reusable components, reducing
duplication and making the system easier to maintain and extend.
- Availability: The system is intended to be accessible at any time from internet enabled
devices, supporting continuous engagement across different user groups.
107
- Security: The system incorporates authentication mechanisms, role based access control
and controlled access to sensitive information to protect users and maintain platform
integrity.
- Scalability: The system is designed to handle multiple users accessing the platform at the
same time without affecting performance.
4.3 System Decomposition
4.3.1 Overview of System Decomposition
System decomposition is a fundamental design activity that involves dividing a complex system
into smaller, manageable, and logically independent subsystems. This approach enhances system
clarity, supports modular development, and simplifies implementation, testing, and maintenance.
By clearly defining subsystem responsibilities and interactions, the overall system becomes
easier to understand and extend.
In the case of StartupConnect Ethiopia, system decomposition is applied to separate core
platform functionalities such as user handling, startup and investment management, mentorship
coordination, communication, and administrative control. Each subsystem is designed to address
a specific functional concern while collaborating with other subsystems to achieve the platform’s
objectives.
This modular structure allows individual subsystems to be developed and modified
independently without affecting the stability of the entire system. It also improves scalability, as
additional features or services can be integrated in the future with minimal impact on existing
components. The decomposition therefore provides a strong architectural foundation for building
a reliable, secure, and maintainable platform that supports interactions among startups, investors,
mentors, and administrators.
4.3.2 High-Level System Decomposition
At a high level, the StartupConnect Ethiopia platform is decomposed into a set of major
subsystems based on functional responsibilities and system roles. These subsystems collectively
support the end-to-end operation of the platform, from user interaction to data storage and
administrative oversight.
The User Management Subsystem is responsible for handling user registration, profile
management, and role assignment for startups, investors, mentors, and administrators. Closely
related to this is the Authentication and Authorization Subsystem, which ensures secure
access through identity verification and role-based access control.
The Core Business Logic Subsystem forms the central processing component of the platform. It
manages startup listings, investor matching, mentorship coordination, and investment workflows
108
by applying predefined business rules and validation logic. This subsystem coordinates
interactions among users and ensures that platform operations follow established processes.
The Data Management Subsystem supports persistent storage and retrieval of system data,
including user profiles, startup information, investment records, and mentorship activities. It
ensures data consistency, integrity, and availability across the platform.
To facilitate smooth interaction between system components, the Communication and
Integration Subsystem manages data exchange between the user interface and backend
services, as well as integration with external services when required.
Finally, the Reporting and Administration Subsystem provides administrative oversight,
system monitoring, and reporting capabilities. This subsystem enables administrators to monitor
platform usage, generate analytical reports, and manage system configurations.
Together, these subsystems form a cohesive and well-structured system architecture that supports
the functional and non-functional requirements of StartupConnect Ethiopia while allowing future
growth and enhancement.

The User Management Subsystem is responsible for handling all activities related to user
accounts within the StartupConnect Ethiopia platform. It serves as the entry point for system
users and manages their identity, profile information, and access privileges. This subsystem
supports different categories of users, including startups, investors, mentors, and system
administrators.
By centralizing user-related operations, the subsystem ensures consistency, security, and proper
access control across the platform. It also interacts closely with the authentication and
authorization mechanisms to ensure that users are granted appropriate permissions based on their
assigned roles.
The User Management Subsystem is decomposed into three main modules: the User Registration
Module, the Profile Management Module, and the Role and Permission Management Module.
110
4.3.3.1 User Registration Module
The User Registration Module is responsible for creating new user accounts on the platform. It
provides structured mechanisms for onboarding startups, investors, mentors, and administrators.
During registration, the module collects essential user information and performs validation to
ensure data accuracy and completeness.
This module verifies that user inputs meet system requirements, such as unique identifiers and
valid contact details. Once the registration process is completed successfully, user information is
stored securely and made available to other system components. The User Registration Module
establishes the initial identity of users and enables them to access the platform’s services after
successful authentication.
4.3.3.2 Profile Management Module
The Profile Management Module allows users to view, update, and manage their personal and
organizational information after registration. This includes profile details relevant to the user’s
role, such as startup descriptions, investment interests, mentorship expertise, or contact
information.
The module ensures that profile updates are validated and stored consistently in the system
database. By allowing users to maintain accurate and up-to-date information, the Profile
Management Module improves the quality of interactions and matching processes across the
platform. It also enhances user engagement by providing flexibility and control over profile data.
4.3.3.3 Role and Permission Management Module
The Role and Permission Management Module controls access to system functionalities based on
predefined user roles. Each user is assigned a role that determines the actions they are permitted
to perform within the platform.
This module enforces role-based access control by ensuring that startups, investors, mentors, and
administrators can only access features relevant to their responsibilities. It also supports
administrative functions such as assigning, updating, or revoking user roles when necessary.
Through this mechanism, the system maintains security, prevents unauthorized operations, and
ensures proper separation of responsibilities.
4.3.4 Authentication and Authorization Subsystem
The Authentication and Authorization Subsystem is responsible for ensuring secure access to the
StartupConnect Ethiopia platform. It verifies user identities and controls access to system
111

The subsystem works closely with the User Management Subsystem to validate user credentials
and enforce access rules. By separating authentication and authorization concerns, the system
achieves a higher level of security and flexibility in managing user access.
The Authentication and Authorization Subsystem is decomposed into two main modules: the
Authentication Module and the Authorization and Access Control Module.
4.3.4.1 Authentication Module
The Authentication Module is responsible for verifying the identity of users attempting to access
the system. It ensures that only registered users with valid credentials can log in to the platform.
This module handles login and logout processes and manages user sessions.
During authentication, user credentials are validated against securely stored records. Appropriate
security mechanisms are applied to protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized
access attempts. Once authentication is successful, the system establishes a secure session that
allows the user to interact with the platform according to their assigned role.
The Authentication Module also supports session termination and error handling, ensuring that
inactive or invalid sessions do not compromise system security.
4.3.4.2 Authorization and Access Control Module
The Authorization and Access Control Module determines what authenticated users are allowed
to do within the system. It enforces role-based access control by mapping user roles to specific
permissions and system functionalities.
This module ensures that users can only access features and data relevant to their responsibilities.
For example, startups can manage their project profiles, investors can review and track
investment opportunities, mentors can provide guidance, and administrators can manage system
configurations and user accounts.
By strictly enforcing access rules, the Authorization and Access Control Module prevents
unauthorized operations and protects critical system resources. It also supports administrative
functions such as modifying permissions and monitoring access-related activities.
4.3.5 Core Business Logic Subsystem
The Core Business Logic Subsystem represents the central processing component of the
StartupConnect Ethiopia platform. It coordinates all primary system operations by applying
predefined rules, workflows, and decision-making mechanisms. This subsystem acts as an
112
intermediary between user interactions and data storage, ensuring that system processes are
executed correctly and consistently.
By isolating the core logic from user interface and data management concerns, the system
achieves better modularity and maintainability. The Core Business Logic Subsystem interacts
with other subsystems such as User Management, Authentication and Authorization, Data
Management, and Communication to support the platform’s functional requirements.
The subsystem is decomposed into three main modules: the Request Processing Module, the
Workflow and Rule Management Module, and the Decision-Making Module.
4.3.5.1 Request Processing Module
The Request Processing Module serves as the entry point for all system requests that require
business logic execution. It receives validated requests from the user interface and determines the
appropriate actions to be performed.
This module is responsible for interpreting user inputs, coordinating with other subsystems, and
initiating relevant workflows. It ensures that incoming requests follow the correct sequence of
operations and that required conditions are met before processing continues. By managing
request flow, this module maintains system stability and consistency during operation.
4.3.5.2 Workflow and Rule Management Module
The Workflow and Rule Management Module defines and enforces the operational rules of the
platform. It manages system workflows such as startup registration approval, investor–startup
interactions, mentorship assignments, and investment tracking processes.
This module ensures that all actions comply with predefined business rules and platform policies.
By centralizing workflow definitions, the system can adapt to changes in operational
requirements without affecting other subsystems. This approach improves flexibility and
supports the evolution of platform processes over time.
4.3.5.3 Decision-Making Module
The Decision-Making Module supports logical and conditional decisions within the system. It
evaluates system states, user inputs, and workflow conditions to determine appropriate outcomes.
This module plays a key role in processes such as approving or rejecting user actions, matching
startups with investors or mentors, and enforcing platform constraints. By systematically
applying decision logic, the module ensures fairness, consistency, and reliability in system
operations.
113
4.3.6 Data Management Subsystem
The Data Management Subsystem is responsible for handling all data-related operations within
the StartupConnect Ethiopia platform. It ensures that data generated and used by the system is
stored, retrieved, and maintained in a secure, consistent, and reliable manner. This subsystem
supports all other subsystems by providing persistent data storage and controlled data access
mechanisms.
By separating data handling responsibilities from business logic and user interface concerns, the
system improves data integrity, scalability, and maintainability. The Data Management
Subsystem interacts closely with the Core Business Logic Subsystem to support operational
processes and decision-making.
The subsystem is decomposed into three main modules: the Database Access Module, the Data
Validation Module, and the Backup and Recovery Module.

of data between the user interface, backend services, and external systems where applicable. This
subsystem ensures that information flows smoothly across the system while maintaining
consistency, security, and performance.
By providing standardized communication mechanisms, the subsystem supports modular design
and simplifies integration with future services. It works closely with the Core Business Logic
and Data Management subsystems to ensure that system requests and responses are handled
efficiently.
The Communication and Integration Subsystem is decomposed into three main modules: the API
Management Module, the External Service Integration Module, and the Error Handling and
Logging Module.
4.3.7.1 API Management Module
The API Management Module provides a structured interface for communication between the
frontend and backend components of the system. It defines how system functionalities are
accessed and how data is exchanged through well-defined endpoints.
This module ensures that requests and responses follow consistent formats and communication
protocols. It also supports input validation and response handling, contributing to system
reliability and maintainability. By centralizing API control, the platform simplifies future
enhancements and integration efforts.
4.3.7.2 External Service Integration Module
The External Service Integration Module enables the system to interact with third-party services

preventing unhandled errors from affecting user experience or system integrity.
4.3.8 Reporting and Administration Subsystem
The Reporting and Administration Subsystem provides oversight, control, and analytical
capabilities for the StartupConnect Ethiopia platform. It supports system administrators in
monitoring platform activities, managing users and resources, and generating reports for
decision-making purposes. This subsystem plays a key role in ensuring transparency,
accountability, and effective system governance.
By centralizing administrative functions and reporting mechanisms, the subsystem enables
efficient system management and supports long-term platform sustainability. It interacts with all
major subsystems to collect relevant operational data and enforce administrative policies.
The Reporting and Administration Subsystem is decomposed into three main modules: the
System Reporting Module, the Monitoring and Audit Module, and the Administrative Control
Module.
4.3.8.1 System Reporting Module
The System Reporting Module is responsible for generating structured reports that summarize
platform activities and system performance. These reports provide insights into user engagement,
startup registrations, investment activities, mentorship interactions, and overall system usage.
The module supports the creation of both periodic and on-demand reports, enabling
administrators to evaluate platform effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. By
presenting data in an organized manner, the System Reporting Module facilitates informed
decision-making and strategic planning.
4.3.8.2 Monitoring and Audit Module
The Monitoring and Audit Module tracks system operations and user activities to ensure
compliance with platform policies and security requirements. It records significant system
events, access attempts, and administrative actions for accountability purposes.
116
This module enables administrators to detect anomalies, investigate incidents, and assess system
health. By maintaining detailed audit logs, the system supports transparency and enhances trust
among platform stakeholders.
4.3.8.3 Administrative Control Module
The Administrative Control Module provides tools for managing and configuring the platform. It
allows administrators to perform tasks such as managing user accounts, controlling access
privileges, configuring system settings, and enforcing platform rules.
Through this module, administrators can maintain system integrity and ensure that platform
operations align with organizational policies. The module also supports system maintenance
activities, contributing to the overall reliability and stability of the platform.
4.4 Architecture of the System
The StartupConnect Ethiopia platform is designed using a modular and scalable system
architecture that supports secure interaction between startups, investors, mentors, and
administrators. The architecture enables efficient data management, seamless communication,
AI-assisted matching, and integration with external services such as local payment gateways.
The system follows a structured approach that separates user interaction, business logic, and data
management. This ensures maintainability, scalability, and ease of future enhancement. Both web
and mobile clients communicate with the backend through secure APIs, allowing consistent
behavior across platforms while maintaining centralized control over core functionalities.
The architecture also supports non-functional requirements such as security, performance, and
reliability, which are critical for handling sensitive business information, mentorship records, and
investment-related data.
4.4.1 Architectural Style
```
The system adopts a Layered Architectural Style (N-tier Architecture), which organizes the
```
system into clearly defined layers, each with specific responsibilities.
The main layers include:
● Presentation Layer:
Provides user interfaces for startups, investors, mentors, and administrators through web
and mobile applications. It handles user input, displays system data, and ensures usability
and accessibility.
117
```
● Application (Business Logic) Layer:
```
Implements core system functionalities such as user authentication, startup verification,
investment workflows, mentorship management, and AI-based recommendation logic.
● Data Access Layer:
Manages interactions with the database, ensuring data consistency, integrity, and secure
storage of user profiles, projects, transactions, and system logs.
● Integration Layer:
```
Handles communication with external services, including local payment gateways (e.g.,
```
```
Telebirr and CBE Birr), notification services, and AI modules.
```
Reason for Selection:
The layered architecture was chosen because it promotes separation of concerns, simplifies
maintenance, enhances system security, and allows independent scaling of system components. It
also supports future expansion, such as adding advanced analytics or additional financial
services, without major architectural changes.
4.4.2 Architectural Pattern
```
The system primarily employs the Model–View–Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to
```
structure its internal design.
● Model:
Represents the system’s data and business entities, including startups, investors, mentors,
projects, investments, and mentorship sessions.
● View:
Consists of the user interfaces that present data to users and capture user interactions
through dashboards, forms, and notifications.
● Controller:
Acts as an intermediary that processes user requests, applies business rules, and
coordinates communication between the model and view.
```
Justification:
```
The MVC pattern improves code organization by separating data, presentation, and control
logic. This enhances maintainability, testability, and development efficiency. It also enables
parallel development of frontend and backend components, which is essential for a multi-user,
feature-rich platform like StartupConnect Ethiopia.
118
Additionally, an Observer Pattern is applied within the notification module to enable real-time
updates for events such as mentorship requests, investment offers, and system alerts.

4.5 Component Diagram
A Component Diagram is a UML diagram used to show the high-level structure of a software
system by illustrating its main components and how they interact. It focuses on functional
decomposition, showing how responsibilities are divided among components and how they
communicate through interfaces. Component diagrams help in understanding system
architecture, managing complexity, and identifying dependencies between subsystems and
external services.

4.7 Database Design
The StartupConnect Ethiopia database is designed using a relational model to store and manage
data for startups, investors, mentors, and administrators. It supports user authentication, profile
management, startup projects, investments, mentorship activities, communication, and payment
tracking. The database ensures data integrity through primary and foreign key relationships and
enables secure, scalable, and efficient system operation aligned with the platform’s functional
requirements.
